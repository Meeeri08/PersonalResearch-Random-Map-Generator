## Random Map Generation

My name is Maria Garrigolas Ledo, student of the [Bachelor's Degree in Video Games Design and Development](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/) at UPC CITM. 

This content is generated for the second year's subject Project II, under supervision of lecturer [Ramon Santamaria](https://github.com/raysan5).

### About the research: What are Random Generated Maps?

The procedural generation is the process to generate content algorithmically rather than manual. In other words, random generated maps are created by computers instead of persons.


### Why do we want random generated maps?

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Meeeri08/PersonalResearch-Random-Map-Generator/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

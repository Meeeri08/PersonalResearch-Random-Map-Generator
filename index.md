## Random Map Generation

My name is Maria Garrigolas Ledo, student of the [Bachelor's Degree in Video Games Design and Development](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/) at UPC CITM. 

This content is generated for the second year's subject Project II, under supervision of lecturer [Ramon Santamaria](https://github.com/raysan5).

### About the research: What are Random Generated Maps?

The procedural generation is the process to generate content algorithmically rather than manual. 

In other words, random generated maps are created by computers instead of persons.

### Why do we want random generated maps?
Nowadays, a video game demands several materials to compose complex and large scene, carrying high costs in their content development. Developers use these algorithms to
reduce the amount of time taken to create a game or certain features of it.

Also, from the player perspective, it is more enjoyable to play a diferent map every time. So replayability is also a very important factor.


### Characteristics of a generated random map
#### Why is it good?

- It saves development time and money
- It can save on memory usage
- It increases replayability
- It creates dynamic content
- It creates a large variety of options

#### Why is it bad?
- You may generate an unplayable world
- Worlds can feel repetitive

### When should we use a random generated map?

### TODOs
#### TODO 1: Create a FastNoiseLite object.
```ruby
FastNoiseLite noise;
```
#### TODO 1.2: Set its Noise type to Perlin noise.
```ruby
noise.SetNoiseType(FastNoiseLite::NoiseType_Perlin); 

```
#### TODO 1.3: Set the seed with SetSeed function.
```ruby
noise.SetSeed(seed);
```
#### TODO 1.4: Set the frequency to 0.05
```ruby
noise.SetFrequency(0.05);

```
Output: Nothing will be shown on screen yet.
#### TODO 2: Store the values generated by Perlin Noise in app->map->height_map.
```ruby
app->map->height_map[x][y] = noise.GetNoise((float)x, (float)y);

```

|Output|
#### TODO 2.1: Noise must be always between 1 and 0 (use the following formula: (Noise + 1) *0.5).
```ruby
app->map->height_map[x][y] = (noise.GetNoise((float)x, (float)y) +1) * 0.5;

```
Output: Nothing will be shown on screen yet.

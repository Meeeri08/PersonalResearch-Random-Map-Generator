## Random Map Generation

My name is Maria Garrigolas Ledo, student of the [Bachelor's Degree in Video Games Design and Development](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/) at UPC CITM. 

This content is generated for the second year's subject Project II, under supervision of lecturer [Ramon Santamaria](https://github.com/raysan5).

### About the research: What are Random Generated Maps?

The procedural generation is the process to generate content algorithmically rather than manual. 

In other words, random generated maps are created by computers instead of persons.

### Why do we want random generated maps?
Nowadays, a video game demands several materials to compose complex and large scene, carrying high costs in their content development. Developers use these algorithms to
reduce the amount of time taken to create a game or certain features of it.

Also, from the player perspective, it is more enjoyable to play a diferent map every time. So replayability is also a very important factor.
